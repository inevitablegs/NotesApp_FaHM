## Description

NotesApp is a versatile and user-friendly application designed to streamline your note-taking experience. Built primarily with Python, it provides a robust backend for managing your thoughts, ideas, and important information, accessible via a web interface or a powerful API. Whether you're a developer looking for a straightforward API to integrate into your projects or a casual user seeking an efficient way to organize daily notes, NotesApp offers a clean and intuitive solution.

This project emphasizes simplicity, extensibility, and ease of use. It's structured to allow for quick deployment and modification, making it an excellent starting point for learning web development with Python or for building upon as a custom note management system.

## Features

NotesApp comes packed with essential features to help you manage your notes effectively:

*   **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for notes.
*   **Database Integration**: Configurable database connection (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) for persistent storage.
*   **RESTful API**: Exposes well-defined API endpoints for programmatic access to notes.
*   **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated modules for models, schemas, routes, and configuration.
*   **Customizable Configuration**: Easy-to-manage configuration files for database settings, server ports, and more.
*   **Lightweight**: Designed to be efficient and performant.

## Installation

To get NotesApp up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Method 1: Clone and Install

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/notesapp.git
    cd notesapp
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: A `requirements.txt` file is expected to be present in the root directory. If not, you may need to manually install dependencies like `FastAPI`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Uvicorn`, etc., based on the project's framework.*

### Method 2: Manual Setup (if `requirements.txt` is missing or for advanced users)

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, or you prefer a more granular setup, you will need to infer the core dependencies. Based on the file structure (`models`, `schemas`, `routes`, `config/db.py`), it's highly likely to use a web framework like FastAPI or Flask and an ORM like SQLAlchemy.

1.  **Install core libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn "sqlalchemy[asyncio]" # Example for FastAPI/SQLAlchemy
    # pip install flask sqlalchemy # Example for Flask/SQLAlchemy
    ```
    *Adjust dependencies based on the actual framework used by the project.*

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the NotesApp application.

### Running the Application

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active** (if you created one).

2.  **Run the main application file**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *(If using Uvicorn with FastAPI, it might be `uvicorn main:app --reload`)*

    You should see output indicating that the server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or a similar address.

### Interacting with the Application (API Examples)

NotesApp exposes a RESTful API for managing notes. Here are some basic `curl` examples:

*   **Create a new note**:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "My First Note", "content": "This is the content of my first note."}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/notes
    ```

*   **Get all notes**:
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/notes
    ```

*   **Get a specific note by ID**:
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/notes/<note_id>
    ```
    (Replace `<note_id>` with the actual ID of the note)

*   **Update a note**:
    ```bash
    curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Title", "content": "New updated content."}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/notes/<note_id>
    ```

*   **Delete a note**:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/notes/<note_id>
    ```

### Web Interface (if applicable)

If NotesApp includes a web frontend (`html`, `css`, `js` files suggest this), you can access it by navigating to the application's URL in your web browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

## Configuration

NotesApp uses configuration files to manage settings, primarily for database connections.

*   **Database Configuration**:
    The main database settings are typically found in `config/db.py`. You might need to adjust the connection string based on your chosen database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).

    Example `config/db.py` (conceptual):
    ```python
    # config/db.py
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

    # Use SQLite for simplicity, or change to your preferred DB
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./notes.db"
    # SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname"

    engine = create_engine(
        SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False} # For SQLite
    )
    SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
    Base = declarative_base()
    ```
    *You may need to modify `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` to point to your desired database.*

*   **Environment Variables**:
    For production deployments, it's recommended to manage sensitive information (like database credentials) using environment variables. You can set them directly in your environment or use a `.env` file with libraries like `python-dotenv`.

    Example `.env` file:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname
    APP_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
    ```
